				<h3><strong>Image Processing and Analysis</strong></h3>
				Film is rarely used by professional Astronomers today.<br />
				Most of the previous plate film that has been captured has been digitized (and available online through the MAST website).<br />
				Images are captured by CCD camera. Usually, exposures are handled by computer software.<br />
				The Astronomer programs the variables like exposure duration, filter selection, calibration, while the software does the rest.<br />
				After image capture, the data is saved as a FITS file. FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System.<br />
				This file type is standard everywhere and allows important header information from the CCD camera to be retained. Additionally, the image is unaltered and is in its native 16 bit format.<br />
				Once captured, software is used to combine, calibrate, enhance, save-as, whatever you can think of. There are several choices available.<br />
				Most, if not all, of these software packages provide CCD control and processing. However, many amateur and professional astronomers have more than one of these packages installed on their system.<br />

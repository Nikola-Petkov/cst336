				<h3><strong>Computers as Astronomy Tools</strong></h3>
				Computers are very important to Astronomers. In so many ways, computers have worked their way into just about every aspect of astronomy - from data storage and data analysis to automatically running a specific list of commands from across the world.
				An example is the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility (IRAF). This software is 100% free (paid by U.S. Tax dollars) and is by far the best software to use for any Astronomy related project.
				This website will briefly introduce how computers are used as tools in astronomy.
				<br /><br />
				To the left is the Pinwheel Galaxy (Messier 101). Messier 101 is a spiral galaxy seen almost face-on.<br />
				The central bulge is composed of old stars giving a yellowish appearance, while the spiral arms host<br />
				younger stars denoted by ther blue-light emission and star formation regions denoted by their red-light emission.<br />
				The core is displaced from the center of the disk, idicating a recent interaction with another galaxy.<br />
